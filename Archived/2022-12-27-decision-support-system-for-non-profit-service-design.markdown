### Project Summary
Many non-profit organizations must select, from an ever expanding menu of options, a set of services for delivery to their communities. Complex interactions between menu items, item time availability, and fluctuations in demand likely occur resulting in a predictive challenge for managers. This project is aimed at combining expert knowledge with data to develop machine intelligence which predicts participation outcomes associated with sets of selections. Managers may then input a proposed schedule of services for evaluation by the support system for assessment. Future work may include: establishment of linked system dynamics models, software modification to enable generation of suggested menus of services, or integration with existing management information systems and process automation.
