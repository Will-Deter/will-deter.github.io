### Abstract
The necessity of specifying complementary dimensions (topological and behavioral) of heterogeneity in network models of segregation is examined.  Previous investigation has shown that heterogeneity of behaviors (preferences) yields reduced emergence of segregation on lattices.  Meanwhile, others have not shown significant reduction in emergence of segregation on more heterogeneous topologies. This work examines the impact of the combination of these heterogeneities to identify an important interaction between them. This synergy, which yields further reduced emergence of segregation, is formalized. Several areas for further or related inquiry are ennumerated.
