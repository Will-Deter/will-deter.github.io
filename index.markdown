Thank you for visiting! This is a collection of my work on the modeling and analysis of complex systems. Projects are ongoing across a broad set of application areas, including management, sustainability, sociology, and others. You can learn more about me or view my curriculum vitae [here](https://will-deter.github.io/about/).  You can browse my project posts below.
