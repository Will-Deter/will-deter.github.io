Thank you for visiting! This is a collection of my work on the modeling and analysis of complex systems. I am primarily interested in the application of systems science to the management of complex systems. Projects are ongoing across a broad set of application areas, including business, climate and sustainability, sociology, public administration and health, disaster management, and others. You can learn more about me or view my curriculum vitae [**here**](https://will-deter.github.io/about/).  You can browse my project posts below.

I am a husband, father, and non-profit professional living and working in Asheville, North Carolina.  As I am sure is true for many others, I am fascinated by the set of opportunities and challenges this region provides. I am particularly interested in working to dismantle the systems that manifest intergenerational harms within our region. The recognition that these harms are the result of systemic issues sparked my interested in the science of systems.  
I will soon complete the MS in Systems Science program @ Binghamton University and plan to enter the PhD program in 2023.

I acknowledge that the land our community lives on today is the ancestral land of the ᏣᎳᎫᏪᏘᏱ Tsalaguwetiyi (Cherokee, East). You can visit [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) to learn more about the Indigenous peoples whose ancestral lands Asheville (or other areas) occupies.
