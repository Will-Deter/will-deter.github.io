Thank you for visiting! This is a collection of my work on the modeling and analysis of complex systems. I am primarily interested in the application of systems science to the management of complex systems. Projects are ongoing across a broad set of application areas, including business, climate and sustainability, sociology, public administration and health, disaster management, and others. You can learn more about me or view my curriculum vitae [**here**](https://will-deter.github.io/about/).  You can browse my project posts below.
