Thank you for visiting! This is a collection of my work on the modeling and analysis of complex systems. I am primarily interested in the application of systems science to the management of complex systems. Most recently, I've been studying heterogeneity in social computation. In my professional life, I use a variety of modeling and machine intelligence methods to better understand complex situations and guide decisions. 

Projects are ongoing across a broad set of application areas. You can browse my project posts below.
