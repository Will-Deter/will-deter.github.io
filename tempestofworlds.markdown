3. We set off from Northu to Hygoni and briefly stayed there. We crossed the river where there was a battle with a chull and two narids (sp?). We met Palandir the wood elf who has been tracking the voids and is aware of some stuff in desert. Does not volunteer tons of info. There were some shaking/vibrating quakelike things. We diverted to Ceanatha where Cephas stole a magical book and then we met some seafaring folks and talked our way onto a boat.
