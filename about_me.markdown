I am a husband, father, and non-profit professional living and working in Asheville, North Carolina.  As I am sure is true for many others, I am fascinated by the set of opportunities and challenges this region provides. I am particularly interested in working to dismantle the systems that manifest intergenerational harms within our region. The recognition that these harms are the result of systemic issues sparked my interested in the science of systems. I will soon complete the MS in Systems Science program @ Binghamton University and plan to enter the PhD program in 2023.
